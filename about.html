        <p>Hello, my name is Matt Hickman. I am currentlty a student at the University of San Diego with strong interest in programming. I enjoy long walks on the beach and small puppies. I also enjoy problem-solving on my computer. I will build up my
          skills in programming as well as some other knowledge and will be embarking on a business venture very soon ... so look out for that. I love designing things and this webpage is one of my first real designs. Much more to come. Stay tuned.</p>
